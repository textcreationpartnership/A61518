            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

The <hi>Church of England</hi> did deſervedly challenge as her due the title of the <hi>Beſt Reformed Church</hi> in the world: Reformed by the <hi>Beſt Authority,</hi> in the moſt <hi>Regular way,</hi> according to the <hi>Beſt pattern,</hi> and neareſt to the <hi>Apoſtolical Canon:</hi> ſtanding as a <hi>City upon an hill,</hi> and ſhewing to the world, more, holy Biſhops, eminently learned Divines, Faithful Diſpenſers of the Sacred Myſteries; and ſome even of the enemies of her Diſcipline being judges) more of the Truth of Religion and real <hi>Power of God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs,</hi> than any Church of Europe beſides; not except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing even thoſe, who pretended to the moſt righteous
<pb facs="tcp:49656:6"/>Government, and Pureſt Diſcipline.

Under which bleſſings ſhe proſpered and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed to the wonder and envy of all round about us. But Proſperity is often (we know) abuſed to Senſuality; In Peace and Plenty men grow wanton; and when the Church hath ſhined moſt in external Beauty and Splendor, and been bleſſed with the greateſt Tranquillity, Christians have been apt to give themſelves over to the greateſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity; and in the greateſt freedom of the Goſpel, to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe their <hi>liberty</hi> to <hi>looſeneſs</hi> and <hi>licentiouſneſs</hi> of life.

               <hi>hands of the Spoylers,</hi> that enriched themſelves with the ſpoyles of the Church: was it not becauſe we provoked the Lord to anger by our iniquities; and were not careful to walk worthy of that Goſpel which we pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed;
<pb facs="tcp:49656:6"/>and thoſe abundant mercies, that we enjoyed? It may be hoped that God hath ere this taught us <hi>Obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence by the things which we have ſuffered.</hi> We are once more through the unfathomable Providences of God, brought into the harbour. Methinks we ſhould now be ſo wiſe, as never more to come near to thoſe Rocks at which we had ſo late and fatal a wrack. Methinks we ſhould now be affraid of ſin and impiety, leſt God again plunge us into the Deep, and overwhelm us with the billows of his indignation: and tremble at the thoughts of Contending and Dividing, leſt we again be broken, and become a prey (not only (as of late) to a bold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truder, who chaſtiſed us with Scorpions, but) to ſuch an enemy, as may deſtroy us for ever. We have once more <hi>the Face of a Church,</hi> the beauty of Order, a Righteous Government, an holy Liturgy eſtabliſhed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; The Freedom of the Goſpel reſtored in Peace. What remains, but that we make it our great deſign to promote the <hi>real intereſt of this Goſpel;</hi> to preſerve the <hi>Purity of Faith;</hi> to advance the <hi>Power of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> to maintain the <hi>Peace of the Church?</hi> Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Piety is the beſt prop and ſupport of Peace: and it is as true, that Peace is the beſt Nurſe and Fence of Religion. He that hath but half an eye may ſee it, and we can never ſufficiently bewail it, that when the ſpirits of men have been hot and eager in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending about ſhadows and circumſtances, againſt exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal forms and orders; there hath been moſt coldneſs in the matter of real Devotion, in the Vitals and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials of Religion <hi>Piety and Peace, Humility and Love, Meekneſs and Obedience.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ſad reflexions on theſe things have been my chief motive to this work, and to preſent theſe papers to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb facs="tcp:49656:7"/>view. Wherein it is not my deſign to engage in a quarrelſome Controverſie, nor to undertake the full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the Cauſe of the Government and Liturgy in every particular; not that I think it cannot be maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (for it hath been ſufficiently done by other hands). but becauſe that doth not anſwer my main intendment: Which is not to diſpute, what Law is fit to be made, or Order to be eſtabliſhed; but, the Law being made, and Order e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed, to conſider how far we are engaged to Peace and Obedience. I cannot but take notice of the great miſtake of men in this caſe, in reference to their own practice and peaceable ſubmiſſion. We are en oyned Conformity, to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey ſuch a Government and Governours, to worſhip God in ſuch a way, to uſe ſuch Rites and Forms: Men ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and oppoſe, and diſpute againſt the Law, as not fit to be made; Cenſure the Governours as too corrupt, or rigorous, and abuſing their authority, as if this were plea enough for our diſobedience.

In this caſe, as we have no call to challenge our Superiours, as not taking the proper way to Peace, and the Advancement of Religion: ſo neither are we obliged to undertake a full Vindication of them in every particular of their practice, or juſtice of their impoſitions. There is a middle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two. We may ſuppoſe them to erre, ſome particular perſons to have corruptions, and in ſome things to deal irregularly: which is but to ſuppoſe them <hi>Men.</hi> The B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And this is the main de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and ſubject of theſe papers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Reader,</hi> expect not here florid elegancies, or flowers of Rhethorick, for thou wilt be miſtaken: I have no ambition to pleaſe or humour the curious fancy; but to ſerve thy ſoul; and by evidence of truth, and plain convictions of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture and Reaſon to ſatisfie thy doubts, and perſwad to Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience and Peace. There are theſe three things that may render the task that I have undertaken difficult to be well performed. The things debated, mine own weakneſs, and the different tempers of men to be ſatisfied.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1.</hi> For the matters before us, they are made the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of as great debate, and managed with as much heat, and bitter exaſperations, as any, that I know. But, let us be intreated impartially to examine our own hearts, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, whether theſe heats ariſe not rather from the intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance of our own ſpirits, than any thing in the nature of the things in diſpute. For Confident I am, that, if we will ſincerely lay by Paſſion and Prejudice, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider things as they are; we ſhall find nothing in any of theſe matters, but what an humble pious man may lawfully cloſe with, and conform unto; and that may well ſtand with <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Peace:</hi> which if it be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, the fault (I fear) will appear to be not ſo much
<pb facs="tcp:49656:8"/>in the <hi>Impoſition,</hi> as our froward <hi>Oppoſition.</hi> I am moreover well aſſured, that would we all conſcientiouſly ſtudy and practice thoſe indiſpenſible commands of the Goſpel, <hi>viz. Holineſs</hi> to God, and <hi>Peace</hi> among our ſelves; we ſhould neither have a mind, or leiſure, to ſtrive ſo much about circumſtances of <hi>Forms</hi> or <hi>Order;</hi> and trouble our ſelves and the Church with our fruitleſs contentions.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> For my ſelf, I confeſs, I have almoſt underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a work without tools: being in a place of very much employment, and very little profits, my leiſure is little, to ſearch the Monuments of Antiquity, and Practice of former ages; and mine abilities and opportunities leſs. Food and Raiment, and the neceſsary charges of a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, devour the whole income of a poor Vicaridge; that many books cannot get into my ſtudy, nor have I had op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of any other Library. Yet ſo far as my ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtock will reach, I have been willing to lay forth my ſelf, and caſt in my Mite to the Church, and I have the boldneſs to promiſe my ſelf, that even in theſe ſheets, the Reader may meet with ſome ſatisfaction about theſe things, from the fountain of Pureſt Antiquity, the <hi>Holy Scriptures,</hi> and ſomething alſo from the following ſtreams in the practice of ſucceeding ages.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> For the other difficulty. I cannot but expect to meet with Readers of different tempers. Some perhaps will think, I have not ſaid enough: others, that I have ſaid too much. But Read impartially, obſerve the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and then judge. All that I aim at is to promote <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Obedience;</hi> and the humble Chriſtian (I ſhall preſume to hope) may here find that which may ſatisfie thoſe ſcruples, and remove thoſe doubts, which interrupt or hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them. All that I wiſh, or deſire the Reader to bring, is,
<pb facs="tcp:49656:8"/>
               <hi>Piety, Judgement,</hi> and <hi>Candour:</hi> that he be willing to learn, and know the truth: judicious, and able to diſcern it, when made known: and ingenuous, ready to acknowledge and embrace it, when he is convinced of it. If we have been miſtaken, let us not think much to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it; nor oppoſe our vain reputation to our duty, or the Publick tranquillity.</p>
            <p>I have adventured theſe Papers into the world; I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent them to thee from a ſincere and honeſt heart; aiming at nothing but to do my part to further and promote the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of true Piety, Conſcientious Obedience, and the Churches Peace. I hope, thou wilt find nothing in them miſ beſeeming the Spirit of the Goſpel, or the meekneſs of a Chriſtian. I would not willingly offend any; but ſerve and profit all. For common infirmities, thy Humanity will paſs them over: and thy Chriſtianity will engage thee to love and pray for all that love Chriſt and his Church, and among them.</p>

Yet through the blindneſs of mans finite under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, who indeed is not able to fathom the abyſs of Gods counſels; and the bold preſumptions of ſome men, who will dare to determine of that, which no mortal man dares ſay he underſtands; it hath been the unhappy fate of this Doctrine to be the matter of the higheſt contention in the Church, a Controverſie of the longeſt continuance, and managed with the ſharpeſt bitterneſs.</p>

But is there any thing in the nature of the Government in diſpute, which muſt needs be the cauſe of a perpetual Schiſm? Or, is there any thing of ſuch a nature in <hi>Epiſcopacy,</hi> which a pious Chriſtian may not ſubmit to, or (at eaſt for peace-ſake) comply with, without ſin?

                     <hi>we muſt be ſubject:</hi> Our buſineſs now, only is to ſatisfie our ſelves and others, whether, and how far we are bound to conform to theſe Laws, in our owning, and ſubmitting to that <hi>Epiſcopal</hi> authority, which <hi>they</hi> have eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed: Or how far we lawfully may do ſo, (and indeed, what we lawfully may do, we are in duty bound to do, when by a juſt authority we are commanded to do it:) This, I am ſure, is moſt neceſſary, to gain, and preſerve our peace.

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Why may they not juſtly require it? Is it for want of authority in their place? No certainly.

Or, Is it, becauſe this obedience which they require, is not to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired? not this neither. For obedience is a duty of inferiors to ſuperiors, and they being made ſuperiors, (whether <hi>by God,</hi> or <hi>the King,</hi> it makes no difference in this caſe) it is due to them: they may require it, and we are then bound to yield it. Beſides, what is it, that they require of us? is it not, <hi>that we do the duties of our places in the Church?</hi> This we are bound to do, whether they require it or no; and ſure, it becomes not ſin to us then, only becauſe it is required.</p>

                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> WE are now alſo come to the cloſe of this Argument. I have given ſome account of all the moſt material Exceptions taken to the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Government</hi> eſtabliſhed in this Church, and, I think, plainly (I hope to the ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:49656:63"/>of all ſober minded) have ſolved all thoſe difficulties, and doubts, that might ſeem to lie in the way, to hinder a Conſcientious Obedience to that <hi>Church-Politie,</hi> which by the expreſs Laws of the Land we are obliged to conform unto. The exceptions, I confeſs, are many of them cited in the words of thoſe <hi>Reverend Brethren of the Presbyterian per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſion:</hi> yet give me leave here ſolemnly and ſeriouſly to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs, that in ſo doing, I had no deſign in the leaſt to enter a quarrel with them, nor to miſ-repreſent their ends; nor, do I here examine how far they may be a Motive to Petition for an alteration or Regulation of the eſtabliſhment, to thoſe in whoſe hands only ſuch a power lies. But the exceptions be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame which were taken of old; and all unſatisfied men do make uſe of theſe, and the others here ſpoken to, (and none elſe that I know) as Arguments to keep off themſelves and others from obeying, and conforming to the Laws in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perſwading themſelves upon theſe very grounds, they ſhould ſin in ſo doing; (and while men are ſetled in thoſe perſwaſions, there can be no hopes of peace, but bitter ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities, and contendings, if not ſeditions and rebellions, while the Laws poſitively require obedience, and puniſh diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience, and yet men think they ſhould ſin if they ſhould obey) I could do no leſs, (if I did any thing to ſatisfie con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience in theſe ſcruples) than to ſhew, that, if <hi>His Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty,</hi> and our undoubted Governours under Him, ſhould not yet ſee reaſon to alter the eſtabliſhment, we are all bound to obey and conform; and that notwithſtanding any thing in theſe exceptions, we lawfully may do ſo, as far as in our places the Laws and Conſtitutions require that we ſhould.</p>

                  <label type="milestone">
                     <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>2</label> And now what remains, but that I paſſionately intreat for Peace and Obedience? We have been divided, and we have contended long enough. O let the <hi>Peace of the Goſpel</hi> be precious in our eyes, and let us by this evidence that we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed obey <hi>the Gospel of Peace:</hi> The way to Peace is not to conſider what our Rulers ſhould do, or how far they ſhould yield to us, but what we ſhould do our ſelves; if they miſtake, their errors in Government will not excuſe the ſin of our diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience. Let us do our parts, and if we have not the wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:49656:64"/>for Peace, the fault will not lie at our Doors: yea, let us do our parts, and we ſhall have Peace. Would we be conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious in our obedience, the Powers of Hell cannot be able to divide and ruine us. The wounds of the Church have been too long open, This is all that we can do to cloſe them. O let the tears of the <hi>Mother,</hi> have ſome effect upon, and draw ſome pity from the hearts of her children; if we unite not, ſhe muſt expire. Unity and Peace is the beſt fence to the Vineyard of God, let us obtain, and maintain this, then ſhall neither the Wild Boare of the Foreſt be able to lay her waſte; nor the ſubtile Foxes within pluck off her grapes, or deſtroy the Vine. It is within reach, we may have it if we will our ſelves: and that only by our obedience and ready ſubmiſſion to the Publick eſtabliſhment. Never look for Peace in this, nay, not in any Church, if the members may refuſe to obey, while ever they ſee any thing which they judge fit to be altered in the Government. But though ſomething there may deſerve an alteration, yet if it be not altered (becauſe thoſe, to whom that power belongs (and they only are judges) ſee it not convenient, becauſe the benefit of alteration poſſibly may not countervail the miſchief of a change) and lawful to be obeyed, The Peace of the Church muſt oblige us to obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Such is our caſe at preſent in reference to the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Epiſcopacy;</hi> it is that only Government which our Laws acknowledge, that which they oblige us to conform to, and wherein it hath been cleared there is nothing but what a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious Chriſtian may lawfully ſubmit to: O then for the Lord-ſake, for the Churches, for Peace, for Conſcience ſake let us obey.</p>
               <p>Let me, for a cloſe of this Chapter, and Argument, but propound theſe four things to be ſeriouſly weighed and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered.</p>

               <p>Theſe things I have cited thus at large, that it may appear, that thoſe ſeveral Practices, and Interlocutions, and Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſals, as in the Liturgy in general, ſo particularly at the <hi>Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,</hi> and the reading of the <hi>Epiſtles,</hi> and <hi>Goſpels,</hi> as we uſe them, in ſuch Sections, and Order, is no new thing in the Church, nor did the ancient Chriſtians think this any way repugnant to the <hi>holy Canon.</hi>

And, when the matter appointed is but the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of ſuch portions of Scripture, me thinks it ſhould not be a matter of contention among wiſe men; how much is to be read, or where, or in what order; whether out of the <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> or <hi>Prophets,</hi> or <hi>Acts;</hi> whether called the <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> or, <hi>for the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle.</hi> Theſe are things (almoſt infinitely) below the <hi>Peace of the Church.</hi>

The like diligence is noted in others, who lived before, and about thoſe Times; in all which, a ſtinted Liturgy was in uſe.</q> Conſidering then (I ſay) this practice of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients, the uſe of a Liturgy can be no Argument of; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſtrict injunctions of <hi>Councels</hi> for Sedulity in preaching, exhorting, inſtructing the people (even when they required alſo the uſe of a Liturgy) this can be no plea for, or means to make an <hi>idle Miniſtry.</hi>

<pb n="218" facs="tcp:49656:128"/>not a total <hi>Eradication,</hi> or deſtruction of all that thing which is to be reformed; but a <hi>Separation</hi> of the <hi>Evil</hi> from the <hi>Good,</hi> of <hi>Errour</hi> from the <hi>Truth;</hi> of corruptions and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, from the good, proper, and holy uſe of a thing.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Sect. </seg>4</label> This is not enough to prove this Book wholly, or only taken out of that. For, let any man but compare them, and they ſhall ſee ſo much difference both in <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Form,</hi> as that they cannot rationally conclude the one to be the only foundation of the other: or this to be wholly taken thence. For, Had not thoſe holy and learned, Reverend men, who were the Compilers of this Liturgy, the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> the holy Word of God before them? Without doubt they had. And are not all thoſe <hi>Chapters of the Old and New Testament,</hi> all thoſe <hi>Pſalms</hi> and <hi>Scriptural Hymns;</hi> all the <hi>Epiſtles</hi> and <hi>Gospels</hi> taken out of thoſe holy Scriptures? Or can we with any ſhadow of reaſon ſay, They are taken out of the Maſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>book, becauſe happily ſome of them may be there, as well as in ours; when it is evident, that theſe, at leaſt, are not taken thence, but from an higher, and purer fountain, <hi>The Word of God.</hi> Again, Had not thoſe holy Compilers many other <hi>Liturgies</hi> alſo before them to conſider, beſides that <hi>Popiſh Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual?</hi> queſtionleſs they had, <hi>Liturgies</hi> uſed in the <hi>Ancient</hi> and <hi>Greek Church,</hi> which owed, and acknowledged no ſubje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction either to the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Church of Rome;</hi> and Forms of Prayer uſed in ſeveral Churches before ever there was a <hi>Pope</hi> (as <hi>Pope</hi> is now taken) in the world. And are not a very great part of our Prayers and Hymns; and many, yea moſt, if not all, thoſe ſhort <hi>

Why
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:49656:129"/>ſhall we ſay then, that they were all taken out of the <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> when thoſe holy men had other <hi>Rituals</hi> in their eye of an elder and purer compoſition? Further, what is retained in ours, and ſound among the Papiſts, is it not good? is it not agreeable to the Word of God? and if ſo, how can we excuſe our ſelves from the guilt of a very great exceſs of uncharitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, when we ſhall ſay, that the framers of this <hi>Liturgy,</hi> took theſe things out of the <hi>Maſs-book,</hi> and not out of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, with which ſo evidently they do agree?</item>

And in this ſenſe do they take it, when they ſay, our <hi>Service-book</hi> is taken out of the Maſs-book: but it ſhould rather be ſaid, The <hi>Maſs-book was in time added to our Communion-book, and by the purging out of the Maſs, it is now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored to its former purity.</hi> Popery is a Scab, or a Lepro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie that cleaveth to the Church; and the <hi>Maſs,</hi> an abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation <hi>ann xed to the Liturgy.</hi> Before the <hi>Maſs</hi> was heard of in the world, or began to be hatched, there was ſtinted Liturgies in the Church, for ſubſtance much what the ſame with ours.— The <hi>Eaſtern</hi> Churches had their Liturgies firſt; and the <hi>Weſtern</hi> borrowed many things from them. —The Ancient Liturgies, attributed to <hi>James, Baſil, Chryſoſtom,</hi> are Counterfeit; — but divers things in them contained were in uſe in the Primitive Church without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion.
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:49656:129"/>They had their appointed <hi>Leſſons</hi> out of the <hi>Law,</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and <hi>Evangeliſts;</hi> their ſtinted Prayers, and <hi>Forms of Celebration,</hi> with ſome va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety, but in ſubſtance all one in a manner.— The Forms were at firſt more brief, afterwards enlarged, and by en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement (as it often happens) corrupted, and defiled. Corruption, as a diſeaſe by this means cleaving to the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turgy, it was neceſſary it ſhould be corrected, and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to its firſt integrity, and ſoundneſs. The <hi>Cardinal Quignonius,</hi> by the command of <hi>Clement the Seventh,</hi> ſo changed the <hi>Roman Breviary,</hi> that for the moſt part it was rather like an <hi>Engliſh Book of Prayers,</hi> than a <hi>Roman Breviary.</hi> And the <hi>Engliſh Liturgy,</hi> gathered according to the <hi>Model of the Ancients,</hi> and the <hi>Pureſt of them, is not a Collection out of the Maſs-book, but a Refining of that Liturgy which heretofore had been ſtained with the Maſs.</hi> — If it was wholly taken out of the <hi>Maſs-book,</hi>

But how unlike are we to thoſe dayes? how many Churches among us ſtand ſhut up, and never open but upon one day in the week, if then; yet then alſo not filled (if at all) till the Sermon begin, as if the Prayers of the Church were none of our Concerns. It is true, that among thoſe Ancients, where they had ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Aſſemblies, there were alſo preaching and inſtructing, and Exhortations: And it is unqueſtionable, preaching of the Word is an undoubted Ordinance of God, for the ſalvation of his people, on which they are bound to attend. Yet I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in too many places, that whatever the pretences of men have been, they have ſhewed as little regard to preaching, as to prayer; though they pretend they come not to Church up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the week-dayes, becauſe there is only the Formal Service, but no inſtructions; yet when Sermons have been offered, yea preached, either on ſtated Lectures weekly, or ſome ſpecial oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions, they have attended as little there, as they now do upon the publick prayers. But beſides, with the prayers do we not conſtantly read the Scriptures? and are not thoſe matter of inſtruction and edification? In the <hi>Jewiſh Church,</hi> they had their <hi>daily Sacrifices,</hi> and <hi>reading of the Law;</hi> but we read not of their daily preachings or expoſitions. O let us not think that all Religion lieth in hearing of a Sermon; it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed a Duty, and we are bound to attend: but the end of that is but to inſtruct and teach us. There is yet ſomewhat to be done by us, ſome publick Sacrifice to be offered up by all. By the Word they are inſtructed; but in this the people offer up no Worſhip; then do they their ſolemn homage to God, when together they make their <hi>Confeſſions,</hi> and offer up their <hi>pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and praiſes.</hi> O let us in this ſhew to the World what God we ſerve, what Religion we own, that indeed we are Chriſtians, by our daily offering Chriſtian-Sacrifices, and conſtant atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the Worſhip of Chriſt; that we are Reformed, En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Chriſtians, by our conſtant attendance on the publick Prayers, and Worſhip of the <hi>Church of England.</hi> The <hi>Church of Rome</hi> enjoins her Members, and the people think

               <p>
                  <hi>To wear the Surplice, if it be unlawfull, it is ſo, either as a thing ſinfull in it ſelf, and ſo ſinfully evil; or only as inconvenient or inexpedient:</hi>
               </p>

               <p>And if neither ſinnefull, nor inconvenient, what ſhould hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any from obeying the Law that enjoyns it? 1. It was granted, and it muſt be confeſſed, that it cannot be ſaid to be <hi>ſinnefull</hi> or <hi>evil in it ſelf,</hi> for all Garments are equally law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full. 2. If the doubt be about the <hi>inconvenience</hi> or <hi>inexpedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy</hi> of it, the beſt way is to compare things and caſes, and ſo judge. And thus did that Learned man reſolve it. We are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to the Miniſtry, and enjoyned to Preach the Goſpel,<note n="q" place="margin">1 Cor. 9.16.</note>

For ſo are her words. 1. <hi>It is obſerved, that though the Jews and Ethnicks derided both the Apoſtles, and the reſt of the Chriſtians for Preaching and believing on him, who was crucified upon the Croſſe; yet they all were ſo far from being diſcouraged from their profeſſion, by the ignominy of the Croſſe, that they gloried, rejoyced, and triumphed in it. Yea the holy Ghoſt by the mouthes of the Apoſtles, did honour the name of the Croſſe (being hatefull among the Jewes) ſo farre, that under it he comprehendeth, not only Chriſt Crucified, but the force and merits of his Death and Paſſion, with all the comforts, fruits, and promiſes, which we expect thereby.</hi> 2. <hi>The honour and dignity of the name of the Croſſe begat a reverent eſtimation even in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles times</hi> (this, we ſee, was the judgment of our Church) <hi>of the Sign of the Croſſe, which the Chriſtians ſhortly after uſed in their actions; thereby making an outward ſhew and profeſſion, that they were not aſhamed to acknowledge him for their Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, who died for them upon the Croſſe. And this Sign they did uſe among themſelves with a kind of Glory, when they met with any Jews; and Signed therewith their Children, when they were Chriſtned— This Sign being uſed in the Primitive Church, both
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:49656:152"/>by the Greeks and Latines, with one conſent and great applauſe. When, if any had oppoſed themſelves againſt it, they would have been cenſured as enemies of the name of the Croſſe, and conſequently of Chriſts merits, the Sign whereof they could no better endure.</hi> All this doth our Church declare; why? but to ſhew her conſent to the Doctrine; and perfect Communion with the Chriſtian Church in thoſe firſt and pureſt ages? yea, and not to forſake the Churches of later dayes in any thing, wherein we might lawfully hold Communion. For ſo ſhe declares in the ſame Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non. <hi>So farre was it from the purpoſe of the Church of</hi> England, <hi>to forſake or reject the Churches of</hi> Italy, France, Spain, Germany, <hi>or any ſuch like Churches, in all things which they held and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed; that, as the Apology of the Church of</hi> England <hi>confeſſeth, it doth with reverence retain thoſe Ceremonies, which do neither endamage the Church of God, nor offend the minds of ſober men: and onely departed from them in thoſe particular points, wherein they were fallen from themſelves in their antient integrity, and from the Apoſtolical Churches, which were their firſt founder.</hi> And this I am ſo far from accounting a crime, that I judg it a duty, and, I think have proved it ſo.</p>

Another end is, by this to make a ſolemn profeſſion, as well <hi>ſignal</hi> as <hi>verbal,</hi> of our faith in a crucified Chriſt; to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie what we believe, and to teach us, that we have no reaſon to be aſhamed of the <hi>Croſſe of Chriſt,</hi> which is our glory and our joy. So are the words uſed at the application of it— <hi>In token that hereafter he ſhall not be aſhamed, to confeſſe the Faith of Chriſt crucified</hi>— As the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> of old, by this made open profeſſion, <hi>even to the aſtoniſhment of the Jews, that they were not aſhamed</hi> to acknowledge <hi>Him, Lord and Saviour, who died on the Croſſe</hi> (as it is in the Canon.)

                  <hi>But now, excepting the Divine inſtitution, in this practice there are all theſe.</hi> 1. <hi>The outward Sign, the Croſſe made in the Forehead.</hi> 2. <hi>The inward Grace, an holy reſolution to fight manfully under the Banner of Chriſt, and to perſevere therein.

But, what cometh home to the matter, and taketh off the <hi>Objection</hi> fully, is this: That in judging <hi>caſes of Scandal,</hi> we are not to look ſo much at the <hi>event,</hi> what it is, or may be; as at the <hi>cauſe</hi> whence it comes. For ſometimes, there is juſt <hi>cauſe of Scandal,</hi> and yet <hi>no Scandal</hi> followeth, becauſe it is <hi>not taken:</hi> Sometimes, <hi>Scandal is taken,</hi> and yet <hi>no juſt cauſe given:</hi> Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times both <hi>cauſe of Scandal given,</hi> and <hi>Scandal thereat taken.</hi> But no man is concerned in any ſcandal, that happeneth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by occaſion of any thing done by him; nor is chargeable with it, farther than he is guilty of having <hi>given it.</hi> If then we <hi>give Scandal</hi> to others, and they <hi>take it not;</hi> the whole guilt is ours, and they are faultleſſe. If we <hi>give it,</hi> and they <hi>take it;</hi> we are to bear a ſhare in the blame, as well as they; and that a deeper ſhare too, for <hi>vae homini,</hi>
                  <note n="a" place="margin">Matth. 18.7.</note> 
                  <hi>Woe to that man, by whom the Scandal,</hi> or, <hi>offence cometh:</hi> But if they <hi>take offence,</hi> where we <hi>give none;</hi> it is a thing we cannot help; and therefore the whole blame muſt lye upon them, and not upon us. The <hi>guilt of Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal</hi> is no more chargeable upon us, who <hi>give not</hi> the occaſion, than upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who was to the <hi>Jew</hi>
